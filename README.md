# 2D-game-wizardAdventure-
This is my first java project, as well as my first time using Visual Studio Code and GitHub. I will be using this repository to track my changes I make to my project. Also so I can look back at how I accomplished certain tasks. I have already started developing my game but I use this to keep track of future changes.
